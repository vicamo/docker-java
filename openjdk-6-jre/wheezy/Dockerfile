# A few problems with compiling Java from source:
#  1. Oracle.  Licensing prevents us from redistributing the official JDK.
#  2. Compiling OpenJDK also requires the JDK to be installed, and it gets
#       really hairy.

# Default to UTF-8 file.encoding
ENV LANG=C.UTF-8 \
	JAVA_VERSION=6b35 \
	JAVA_DEBIAN_VERSION=6b35-1.13.7-1~deb7u1

RUN apt-get update \
	&& apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y --force-yes \
		openjdk-6-jre-headless="$JAVA_DEBIAN_VERSION" \
		unzip \
	&& apt-get clean \
	&& rm -f /var/lib/apt/lists/*_dists_*
